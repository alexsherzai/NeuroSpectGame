Clone the entire repository to test the game on your Unity Engine. All my work is in the Assets folder.

  - Interference is the scene in which the shape pattern recognition game occurs
  - Recall is the scene which tests how many images the user remembered from the Encoding Scene
  - FinalScore is the scene that displays the users performance
